The mind map has been built using EdrawMind Software during my preparation for the AWS Certified Developer Associate (DVA-C01) exam.

To access the file in Read mode:
1. Install EdrawMind software: https://www.edrawmind.com/download-desktop.html
2. Download the mind map from this repository
3. Open in EdwarMind Software

   For Edit Mode (mainly to add new topics): You need to purchase an EdrawMind License since it contains more than 100 topics.
